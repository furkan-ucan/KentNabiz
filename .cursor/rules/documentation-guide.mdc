# Documentation Guide (`docs/`)

This guide provides an overview of the documentation structure within the `[docs/](mdc:docs)` directory and the purpose of its key files and subdirectories.

## General Documentation Files

*   `[README.md](mdc:README.md)` (Root): The main entry point to the project, providing a high-level overview, setup instructions, and links to other important resources.
*   `[docs/architecture.md](mdc:docs/architecture.md)`: Details the overall system architecture, components, and their interactions.
*   `[docs/technical-docs.md](mdc:docs/technical-docs.md)`: Contains general technical documentation, which might include coding standards, environment setup, or other technical guides not specific to a single component.
*   `[docs/api-docs.md](mdc:docs/api-docs.md)`: Documents the project's APIs, including endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication mechanisms.
*   `[docs/requirements.md](mdc:docs/requirements.md)`: Outlines the functional and non-functional requirements of the project.
*   `[docs/tree.md](mdc:docs/tree.md)`: Likely provides a file or directory tree structure of the project for quick navigation or understanding of the layout.
*   `[docs/rfc-docs.md](mdc:docs/rfc-docs.md)`: Central location or index for Request for Comments (RFC) documents.
*   `[docs/project-planning.md](mdc:docs/project-planning.md)`: General project planning documents, timelines, or roadmaps.
*   `[docs/@progress.md](mdc:docs/@progress.md)` and `[docs/@project-status.md](mdc:docs/@project-status.md)`: These files likely track the ongoing progress and overall status of the project or specific parts of it.

## Sprint Planning Documents

Files named `sprint-X-plan.md` (e.g., `[docs/sprint-1-plan.md](mdc:docs/sprint-1-plan.md)`, `[docs/sprint-2-plan.md](mdc:docs/sprint-2-plan.md)`) detail the scope, goals, and tasks for each specific sprint.

## Implementation Phase Documents

Files named `impl-fazX.md` (e.g., `[docs/impl-faz1.md](mdc:docs/impl-faz1.md)`, `[docs/impl-faz2.md](mdc:docs/impl-faz2.md)`, `[docs/impl-faz11.md](mdc:docs/impl-faz11.md)`) document the implementation details of different phases or significant features of the project. These are crucial for understanding the design choices and development process for specific parts of the system.

## Test Documentation

*   `[docs/test-docs.md](mdc:docs/test-docs.md)`: Contains information regarding testing strategies, test plans, or specific test case documentation.

## RFC Directory

*   `[docs/rfc/](mdc:docs/rfc)`: This directory is dedicated to storing Request for Comments (RFC) documents, which are formal proposals or discussions about specific features, designs, or changes to the project.

By maintaining these detailed documents, the project ensures clarity in its development process, architecture, and goals.
